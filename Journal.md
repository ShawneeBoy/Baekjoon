Today, I spent nearly 30 minutes trying to figure out how to connect my existing Github repository to my GoormIDE project.
I love this service because it lets me code in the army, but goddamn it's buggy as fuck.
I guess I'll figure out how to make things work out tomorrow -- but atm I just wanna watch some Youtube.
Honestly, the reason I'm writing this right now is so that I can keep up my daily commit streak. 
I know, I know -- I'm cheating.
But guess what?
fuck you lol

Today was actually pretty good. I mean, I got let out from work at 7:30 PM because my fucking XO had us print this super long secret document that took 5 hours to print, but other than that I talked with my seniors a lot, joked around, and besides, we get a day off tomorrow. All in all, pretty satisfactory day in a few days lol
